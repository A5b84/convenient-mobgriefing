[CurseForge link](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/convenient-mobgriefing)



Makes the `mobGriefing` gamerule more convenient by splitting it into four gamerules:

- `mobGriefing` for most mobs that destroy your world
- `mobGriefingLenient` for passive mobs and things that aren't really annoying
- `mobGriefingWither` for the Wither
- `mobGriefingDragon` for the Ender Dragon

New gamerules are enabled by default.



`mobGriefing` allows:

- Creepers and Ghasts to blow stuff up
- Endermen to take and place blocks

`mobGriefingLenient` allows:

- Villagers to harvest crops
- bartering with Piglins
- Sheeps to eat grass

    - pick up loot
    - turn farmland to dirt when falling
    - place wither roses when killed by a Wither
    - break turtle eggs
    - lit campfires

Requires the [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net)

The [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) is required for localisation, but the mod should still work without it.
